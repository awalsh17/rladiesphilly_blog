      <description>Our June meetupOur June meetup was about cleaning data using R. Data cleaning is the process of preparing your data for analysis; ensuring that it is technically correct and in the desired format. Data cleaning can often be more time-consuming than the actual analysis!
We were live tweeting the event! Check out some tweets below.
IntroductionDarina and Katerina provided an introduction to data cleaning, with a focus on the process of ensuring the data is technically correct.</description>

      <description>Our April Event! The April R-Ladies meetup was held on April 19th at Drexel. Thanks again to Drexel for hosting us and to DataCamp and the R consortium for sponsoring us!
Our topic was an introduction to text mining in R using the first two chapters of “Text Mining with R” by fellow R-Lady(!) Julia Silge and David Robinson.
There was a great group - including some new faces!
 Amy took us through the key concepts of the chapter and then we broke into groups to do some exercises together.</description>

      <description>Why do a new member survey?One of the goals of R-Ladies Philly is for the group to be focused on the needs and interests of its members. With this goal in mind, we created a survey to query members about meeting logistics and R experience level. This survey also provided a mechanism to collect emails in order to invite new members to our Slack channel.
If you want to join us and fill out the survey, you can find it here: http://bit.</description>
