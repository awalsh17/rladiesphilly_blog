In this month’s workshop, Shannon Pileggi gives us a step by step guide for how to get started, and shares her experience with “usethis”, “devtools” and various handy functions for package development. This workshop, suitable for beginner to intermediate R users, aims to help participants develop a working, well-documented package, and provides insights into the files and file structure required for R packages.</description>

      <description>Data cleaning is the process of preparing your data for analysis; ensuring that it is technically correct and in the desired format. Data cleaning can often be more time-consuming than the actual analysis! This was our second meetup on the topic. Click here for a recap of our first data cleaning meetup in June.
Reshaping data We began with an introduction to reshaping data from Alice. The presentation was based on the DataCamp tutorial Long to Wide Data in R.</description>

Our topic was an introduction to text mining in R using the first two chapters of “Text Mining with R” by fellow R-Lady(!) Julia Silge and David Robinson.
There was a great group - including some new faces!
 Amy took us through the key concepts of the chapter and then we broke into groups to do some exercises together.</description>
