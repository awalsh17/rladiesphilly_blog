Data cleaning can often be more time-consuming than the actual analysis! This was our second meetup on the topic. Click here for a recap of our first data cleaning meetup in June.
Reshaping data We began with an introduction to reshaping data from Alice. The presentation was based on the DataCamp tutorial Long to Wide Data in R.</description>

      <description>Our April Event! The April R-Ladies meetup was held on April 19th at Drexel. Thanks again to Drexel for hosting us and to DataCamp and the R consortium for sponsoring us!
Our topic was an introduction to text mining in R using the first two chapters of “Text Mining with R” by fellow R-Lady(!) Julia Silge and David Robinson.
There was a great group - including some new faces!
 Amy took us through the key concepts of the chapter and then we broke into groups to do some exercises together.</description>
