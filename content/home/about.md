# About

R-Ladies Philly is part of a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community. 

R-Ladies Philly is a free, community-driven group that is open to all levels of R users. While our group name does have ‘Ladies’ in the title, we welcome all individuals who share our values. Our monthly meetings are skills-focused, with encouragement of interdisciplinary statistical and coding methods.

Join the R-Ladies Philly [Slack](http://bit.ly/join-rladies-slack)! Email [philly@rladies.org](mailto:philly@rladies.org) to request an invitation. Then check back here or visit our [Meetup](https://meetup.com/rladies-philly) page for event details.
