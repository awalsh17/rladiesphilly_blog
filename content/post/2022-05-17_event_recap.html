<p>On May 17 2023, 40+ R-ladies Philly members joined this wonderful workshop given by <a href="https://eleafeit.com/">Elea McDonnell Feit</a> who is an Associate Professor of Marketing and Associate Dean of Research at Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business. She is also the co-author of R for Marketing Research and Analytics. We learned how to use the {grf} R package to analyze an example dataset!</p>
<p>The workshop covers three major topics using a real world dataset (an experiment on Rhea chicks):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Analyzing a randomized experiment with linear models - what is the “average treatment effect” (ATE)</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding “treatment modifiers” by estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs)</p></li>
<li><p>Introducing Causal Forests: A flexible way to identify important modifiers and relate them to treatment effects</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Miss it? No worries!</p>
<p>The workshop <a href="https://eleafeit.github.io/Causal_Forests_Tutorial/Causal_Forests_Tutorial.html#1">slides</a> and <a href="https://eleafeit.github.io/Causal_Forests_Tutorial/">code</a> are available!</p>
<p>You can watch the workshop recording at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcfHr0oeOMw">R-Ladies Philly YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>We send a huge thank you to our speaker <a href="https://eleafeit.com/">Elea</a> and all our participants.</p>
<p>As for our star dataset, we thank Sue McDonnell for sharing the Rhea Chicks Experiment data reported in Koch, Colleen S., et al. “Training Rhea americana chicks to walk voluntarily across a scale; effect on the handler’s time and the chicks’ weight gain compared with traditional techniques: A pilot study.” Journal of Veterinary Behavior 18 (2017): 69-75.</p>
