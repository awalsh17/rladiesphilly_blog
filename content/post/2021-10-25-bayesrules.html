<p>Bayesian statistics can be really intimidating! Alicia and her co-authors set out to demystify Bayesian statistics. On October 18th, 2021, we hosted Alicia for an interactive workshop on Bayesian statistics in R where we learned about the difference between Bayesian and Frequentist statistics and how to work with Bayesian statistics in R with the <code>bayesrules</code> R package.</p>
<p>The Rmd and Slides from the event are available here: <a href="https://github.com/ajohns24/r-ladies-philly" class="uri">https://github.com/ajohns24/r-ladies-philly</a></p>
<p>The book can be found for free at: <a href="https://www.bayesrulesbook.com" class="uri">https://www.bayesrulesbook.com</a></p>
