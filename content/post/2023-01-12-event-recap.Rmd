On January 12th, we hosted a wonderful career panel to talk about what it is really like to be a data scientist! Our panelists from various data careers discussed their day-to-day jobs, training, and answered attendee questions.

We were joined by four excellent panelists

- Analytics Engineer: [Marieke Jackson](https://skinnamarieke.com/)
- DevOps/ML Ops: [Isabel Zimmerman](https://github.com/isabelizimm)
- Research Scientist/Data Analytics for Research Group: [Julia Schuchard, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-schuchard-47b32457)
- Data Scientist: [Jessica Streeter](https://phillynerd.netlify.app/)
