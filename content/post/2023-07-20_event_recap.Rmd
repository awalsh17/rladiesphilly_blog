### An in person introduction to git/GitHub workshop!

This July, R-Ladies Philly hosted an in-person interactive workshop on version control with git & GitHub with amazing presenters, Shannon Pileggi and E. David Aja!

The learning objectives from this workshop were

-   Employ version control via git and GitHub with operations including commit, push and + pull.
-   Fork and clone from remote repositories.
-   Describe the importance of viewing commits and diffs.
-   Compile markdown reports from an R script for sharing code products on GitHub.
-   Create a project web site via GitHub Pages.
-   Compare and execute different methods to re-visit previous versions of projects.
-   Utilize branches as safety nets for code experimentation.
-   Explain situations that can create merge conflicts and strategies to resolve them.

We have a great time getting to see some old friends and meet some new R users at this event. 

If you missed the event and want to get started with git from R, we recommend https://happygitwithr.com/
