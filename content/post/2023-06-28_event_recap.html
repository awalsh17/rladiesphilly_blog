<h3>Lightning Talks w/ R Ladies Philly</h3>
<p>We had our annual Lightning Talks on June 28th, 2023. These short and insightful talks covered a variety of R topics used by our members to tackle problems from new to advanced users. We were joined by R Ladies DC and sponsored by O’Reilly Media who provided us with a book prize to give out to our attending members in a raffle.</p>
<p>Check out our speakers and brief snippet of their talk:</p>
<p><strong>Data wrangling in R for SAS users‘ by Priyanka Gagneja</strong>
This talk is about how to make it easy to translate legacy SAS codes with R. This can be a good starting point for SAS programmers who don’t know much R and for R users who do not know SAS.</p>
<p><strong>‘Leveraging Open-Source Communities for Professional Development’ by Hebah Bukhari</strong>
A few years ago I made a career switch and picked up R as a coding language. I didn’t have any coding background before. I began in an accredited program, but everything I learned about R and coding has been through the contribution of the R community and the help of its generous members.</p>
<p><strong>‘Imaging R: An Interactive Web Application for Visualizing Multimodality Imaging Data Using R and Shiny’ by Kiki Zhang</strong>
I developed an R-based web application that provides interactive image processing, analysis, and visualization. Multimodal data can be explored intuitively through the analysis pipelines comprising spectral density and time-lagged cross-correlation analyses for quantifying variation in neuronal dynamics and observing interaction dynamics patterns between signals.</p>
<p><strong>‘Using the OpenAI API With Your Prompt + Your Data’ by Abigail Haddad</strong>
I’ll show how I’m using the R openAI package to work with the GPT-4 API. My example involves creating fake resumes by combining custom prompts with job-related data from a .csv file, showing how we can use the API to iterate through a dataset for text generation. I’ll also mention a couple of NLP projects that I’m doing that use the same general format of prompt + iterating through text.</p>
<p><strong>‘Tidyverse Style Guide’ by Arati Krishnamoorthy</strong>
A guide to using the tidyverse style guide.</p>
