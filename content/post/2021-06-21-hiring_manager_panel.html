<p><em>On June 3rd 2021, we partnered with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/">DataPhilly</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TheDataLab/">The DataLab</a> to host a panel event with hiring managers in the fields of Data Science and Data Engineering</em></p>
<div id="the-event" class="section level1">
<h1>The event</h1>
<p>Panelists shared their experiences of the hiring process and their recommendations for job-seekers. The discussion was expertly-moderated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessiepluto/">Jessie Pluto</a>, one of the R-Ladies Philly organizers. We asked the panel a mix of questions that attendees had submitted ahead of time and live-upvoted questions. The panel was followed by smaller conversations in breakout rooms, providing the opportunity for attendees to ask the panelists questions directly.</p>
